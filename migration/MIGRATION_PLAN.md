# Laravel 9 to 12 Migration Plan

This document outlines the steps to migrate the application from Laravel 9 to Laravel 12.

## Guiding Principles

- **Test-Driven Development:** For each step, we will first write tests that fail, then implement the changes to make them pass. This ensures that the application remains stable throughout the migration process.
- **Incremental Updates:** We will upgrade one major version at a time (9 -> 10 -> 11 -> 12). This makes it easier to identify and fix breaking changes.
- **Documentation:** We will keep track of our progress in `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md`.

## Migration Steps

1.  **Preparation & Analysis (Current Step)**
    *   [x] Create migration documentation (`MIGRATION_PLAN.md`, `PROJECT_STATE.md`, `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md`).
    *   [ ] Analyze existing codebase for potential issues.
    *   [ ] Review the official Laravel upgrade guides for versions 10, 11, and 12.
    *   [ ] Ensure existing test suite is green.

2.  **Upgrade to Laravel 10**
    *   [ ] Update `composer.json` to require Laravel 10.
    *   [ ] Update other dependencies to versions compatible with Laravel 10.
    *   [ ] Run `composer update`.
    *   [ ] Fix breaking changes based on the upgrade guide.
    *   [ ] Write/update tests for deprecated features.
    *   [ ] Run tests and ensure they are all passing.

3.  **Upgrade to Laravel 11**
    *   [ ] Update `composer.json` to require Laravel 11.
    *   [ ] Update other dependencies to versions compatible with Laravel 11.
    *   [ ] Run `composer update`.
    *   [ ] Fix breaking changes based on the upgrade guide. This will be a significant step due to the new application structure in Laravel 11.
    *   [ ] Write/update tests for deprecated features.
    *   [ ] Run tests and ensure they are all passing.

4.  **Upgrade to Laravel 12**
    *   [ ] Update `composer.json` to require Laravel 12.
    *   [ ] Update other dependencies to versions compatible with Laravel 12.
    *   [ ] Run `composer update`.
    *   [ ] Fix breaking changes based on the upgrade guide.
    *   [ ] Write/update tests for deprecated features.
    *   [ ] Run tests and ensure they are all passing.

5.  **Post-Migration Cleanup**
    *   [ ] Remove any temporary code or flags used during the migration.
    *   [ ] Review and refactor code to leverage new features in Laravel 12.
    *   [ ] Update documentation.
    *   [ ] Final round of testing.
